# RAS-OCC

The RAS-OC classification system (Response-Adapted Surgery for Oral Cavity cancer) is a structured classification system developed to standardize documentation and reporting of surgical adaptations following neoadjuvant therapy for locoregionally advanced oral cavity cancers. It was created to fill a gap in clinical oncology where consistent terminology was lacking for describing how surgical plans change based on tumor response to pre-operative therapy.
